        Provides a resource to attach elastic IP subnets to devices.

        To attach an IP subnet from a reserved block to a provisioned device, you must derive a subnet CIDR belonging to
        one of your reserved blocks in the same project and facility as the target device.

        For example, you have reserved IPv4 address block 147.229.10.152/30, you can choose to assign either the whole
        block as one subnet to a device; or 2 subnets with CIDRs 147.229.10.152/31' and 147.229.10.154/31; or 4 subnets
        with mask prefix length 32. More about the elastic IP subnets is [here](https://www.packet.com/developers/docs/network/basic/elastic-ips/).

        Device and reserved block must be in the same facility.
