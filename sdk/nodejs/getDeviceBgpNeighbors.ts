/**
 * Use this datasource to retrieve list of BGP neighbors of a device in the Packet host.
 *
 * To have any BGP neighbors listed, the device must be in BGP-enabled project and have a BGP session assigned.
 *
 * To learn more about using BGP in Packet, see the packet.BgpSession resource documentation.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as packet from "@pulumi/packet";
 *
 * const test = packet.getDeviceBgpNeighbors({
 *     deviceId: "4c641195-25e5-4c3c-b2b7-4cd7a42c7b40",
 * });
 * export const bgpNeighborsListing = test.then(test => test.bgpNeighbors);
 * ```
