/**
 * Use this datasource to get CIDR expressions for allocated IP blocks of all the types in a project, optionally filtered by facility.
 * 
 * There are four types of IP blocks in Packet: global IPv4, public IPv4, private IPv4 and IPv6. Both global and public IPv4 are routable from the Internet. Public IPv4 block is allocated in a facility, and addresses from it can only be assigned to devices in that facility. Addresses from Global IPv4 block can be assigned to a device in any facility.
 * 
 * The datasource has 4 list attributes: `globalIpv4`, `publicIpv4`, `privateIpv4` and `ipv6`, each listing CIDR notation (`<network>/<mask>`) of respective blocks from the project.
 *
