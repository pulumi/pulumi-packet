/**
 * Use this data source to get CIDR expression for precreated IPv6 and IPv4 blocks in Packet.
 * You can then use the cidrsubnet TF builtin function to derive subnets.
 * 
 * ## Example Usage
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as packet from "@pulumi/packet";
 * 
 * const projectId = "<UUID_of_your_project>";
 * const test = pulumi.output(packet.getPrecreatedIpBlock({
 *     addressFamily: 6,
 *     facility: "ewr1",
 *     projectId: projectId,
 *     public: true,
 * }));
 * const web1 = new packet.Device("web1", {
 *     billingCycle: "hourly",
 *     facility: "ewr1",
 *     hostname: "web1",
 *     operatingSystem: "ubuntu_16_04",
 *     plan: "t1.small.x86",
 *     projectId: projectId,
 * });
 * const fromIpv6Block = new packet.IpAttachment("from_ipv6_block", {
 *     cidrNotation: test.apply(test => (() => {
 *         throw "tf2pulumi error: NYI: call to cidrsubnet";
 *         return (() => { throw "NYI: call to cidrsubnet"; })();
 *     })()),
 *     deviceId: web1.id,
 * });
 * ```
